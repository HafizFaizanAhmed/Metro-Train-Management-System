Designed and implemented a comprehensive database for a metro train system, optimizing the management of information related to stations, lines, trains, schedules, fares, and users. Efficient query mechanisms were developed to ensure reliable data access, updates, and overall integrity across the system. The database schema was designed to cover all essential aspects, including tables for stations, lines, trains, fares, tickets, users, and trips. Additionally, the schema accounted for maintenance, incidents, customer service inquiries, and fare payments, ensuring a well-rounded and robust data structure. The design prioritized both data consistency and performance, enabling seamless operations and real-time updates for the metro system.
